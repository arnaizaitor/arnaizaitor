## 👋 Hi there, I’m Aitor

🚀 I lead the DevOps Automation team at **Airbus Defence & Space**, where I'm focused on building scalable, reusable systems that simplify development workflows and boost software quality.

### 🧠 What I'm into

- 🔁 **Automation addict** – I love making things run by themselves, and better.
- 🧱 Architecting internal tooling & frameworks for CI/CD and DevOps processes.
- 💬 Strong focus on **Python**, especially in automation and backend systems.
- ⚙️ Deep interest in **template-based engineering**, **process optimization**, and delivering tools developers actually enjoy using.
- 🧠 Always exploring: currently interested in **Go**, and diving deeper into **TypeScript** via **React** projects.

### 🤝 Let’s collaborate!

I'm open to contributing to open source projects related to:

- DevOps / CI-CD automation
- Python ecosystems
- Internal platforms & infrastructure tooling
- AI / ML / NLP automation pipelines
